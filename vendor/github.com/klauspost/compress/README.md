# compress

This package is based on an optimized Deflate function, which is used by gzip/zip/zlib packages.

It offers slightly better compression at lower compression settings, and up to 3x faster encoding at highest compression level.

# usage

The packages are drop-in replacements for standard libraries. Simply replace the import path to use them:

| old import         | new import                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `compress/gzip`    | `github.com/klauspost/compress/gzip`    |
| `compress/zlib`    | `github.com/klauspost/compress/zlib`    |
| `archive/zip`      | `github.com/klauspost/compress/zip`     |
| `compress/deflate` | `github.com/klauspost/compress/deflate` |

You may also be interested in [pgzip](https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip), which is a drop in replacement for gzip, which support multithreaded compression on big files and the optimized [crc32](https://github.com/klauspost/crc32) package used by these packages.

The packages contains the same as the standard library, so you can use the godoc for that: [gzip](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/gzip/), [zip](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip/),  [zlib](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/zlib/), [flate](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/).

Currently there is only minor speedup on decompression (mostly CRC32 calculation).

# deflate optimizations

* Minimum matches are 4 bytes, this leads to fewer searches and better compression. (In Go 1.7)
* Stronger hash (iSCSI CRC32) for matches on x64 with SSE 4.2 support. This leads to fewer hash collisions. (Go 1.7 also has improved hashes)
* Literal byte matching using SSE 4.2 for faster match comparisons. (not in Go)
* Bulk hashing on matches. (In Go 1.7)
* Much faster dictionary indexing with `NewWriterDict()`/`Reset()`. (In Go 1.7)
* Make Bit Coder faster by assuming we are on a 64 bit CPU. (In Go 1.7)
* Level 1 compression replaced by converted "Snappy" algorithm. (In Go 1.7)
* Uncompressible content is detected and skipped faster. (Only in BestSpeed in Go)
* A lot of branching eliminated by having two encoders for levels 4-6 and 7-9. (not in Go)
* All heap memory allocations eliminated. (In Go 1.7)

* "Speed" is compression level 1
* "Default" is compression level 6
* "Compress" is compression level 9
* Test files are [Digits](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/blob/master/testdata/e.txt) (no matches) and [Twain](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/blob/master/testdata/Mark.Twain-Tom.Sawyer.txt) (plain text) .

As can be seen it shows a very good speedup all across the line.

`Twain` is a much more realistic benchmark, and will be closer to JSON/HTML performance. Here speed is equivalent or faster, up to 2 times.

**Without assembly**. This is what you can expect on systems that does not have amd64 and SSE 4:

So even without the assembly optimizations there is a general speedup across the board.

## level 1-3 "snappy" compression

Levels 1 "Best Speed", 2 and 3 are completely replaced by a converted version of the algorithm found in Snappy, modified to be fully
compatible with the deflate bitstream (and thus still compatible with all existing zlib/gzip libraries and tools).
This version is considerably faster than the "old" deflate at level 1. It does however come at a compression loss, usually in the order of 3-4% compared to the old level 1. However, the speed is usually 1.75 times that of the fastest deflate mode.

In my previous experiments the most common case for "level 1" was that it provided no significant speedup, only lower compression compared to level 2 and sometimes even 3. However, the modified Snappy algorithm provides a very good sweet spot. Usually about 75% faster and with only little compression loss. Therefore I decided to *replace* level 1 with this mode entirely.

Input is split into blocks of 64kb of, and they are encoded independently (no backreferences across blocks) for the best speed. Contrary to Snappy the output is entropy-encoded, so you will almost always see better compression than Snappy. But Snappy is still about twice as fast as Snappy in deflate mode.

Level 2 and 3 have also been replaced. Level 2 is capable is matching between blocks and level 3 checks up to two hashes for matches it will try.

## compression levels

This table shows the compression at each level, and the percentage of the output size compared to output
at the similar level with the standard library. Compression data is `Twain`, see above.

(Not up-to-date after rebalancing)

| Level | Bytes  | % size |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1     | 194622 | 103.7% |
| 2     | 174684 | 96.85% |
| 3     | 170301 | 98.45% |
| 4     | 165253 | 97.69% |
| 5     | 161274 | 98.65% |
| 6     | 160464 | 99.71% |
| 7     | 160304 | 99.87% |
| 8     | 160279 | 99.99% |
| 9     | 160279 | 99.99% |

To interpret and example, this version of deflate compresses input of 407287 bytes to 161274 bytes at level 5, which is 98.6% of the size of what the standard library produces; 161274 bytes.

This means that from level 4 you can expect a compression level increase of a few percent. Level 1 is about 3% worse, as descibed above.

# linear time compression (huffman only)

This compression library adds a special compression level, named `ConstantCompression`, which allows near linear time compression. This is done by completely disabling matching of previous data, and only reduce the number of bits to represent each character. 

This means that often used characters, like 'e' and ' ' (space) in text use the fewest bits to represent, and rare characters like '¤' takes more bits to represent. For more information see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) or this nice [video](https://youtu.be/ZdooBTdW5bM).

Since this type of compression has much less variance, the compression speed is mostly unaffected by the input data, and is usually more than *180MB/s* for a single core.

The downside is that the compression ratio is usually considerably worse than even the fastest conventional compression. The compression raio can never be better than 8:1 (12.5%). 

The linear time compression can be used as a "better than nothing" mode, where you cannot risk the encoder to slow down on some content. For comparison, the size of the "Twain" text is *233460 bytes* (+29% vs. level 1) and encode speed is 144MB/s (4.5x level 1). So in this case you trade a 30% size increase for a 4 times speedup.

For more information see my blog post on [Fast Linear Time Compression](http://blog.klauspost.com/constant-time-gzipzip-compression/).

This is implemented on Go 1.7 as "Huffman Only" mode, though not exposed for gzip.


# gzip/zip optimizations
 * Uses the faster deflate
 * Uses SSE 4.2 CRC32 calculations.

Speed increase is up to 3x of the standard library, but usually around 2x. 

This is close to a real world benchmark as you will get. A 2.3MB JSON file. (NOTE: not up-to-date)
