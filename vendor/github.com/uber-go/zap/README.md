# :zap: zap [![GoDoc][doc-img]][doc] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov]

Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.

## Installation
`go get -u github.com/uber-go/zap`

## Structure

Zap takes an opinionated stance on logging and doesn't provide any
`printf`-style helpers. Rather than `logger.Printf("Failed to fetch URL %s
(attempt %v), sleeping %s before retry.", url, tryNum, sleepFor)`, zap
encourages the more structured

```go
logger.Info("Failed to fetch URL.",
  zap.String("url", url),
  zap.Int("attempt", tryNum),
  zap.Duration("backoff", sleepFor),
)
```

This a bit more verbose, but it enables powerful ad-hoc analysis, flexible
dashboarding, and accurate message bucketing. In short, it helps you get the
most out of tools like ELK, Splunk, and Sentry. All log messages are
JSON-serialized, though PRs to support other formats are welcome.

For compatibility with the standard library and [bark][], zap provides the
`zwrap.Standardize` and `zbark.Barkify` wrappers. Both are slower than the core
zap logger, but faster than the libraries they replace.

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive and
make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Zap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and it offers a variety of type-safe ways to add structured
context to your log messages. It strives to avoid serialization overhead and
allocations wherever possible, so collecting rich debug logs doesn't impact
normal operations.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more
performant than comparable structured logging libraries &mdash; it's also faster
than the standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of
salt.<sup id="anchor-versions">[1](#footnote-versions)</sup>

Log a message and 10 fields:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| :zap: zap | 1279 ns/op | 705 B/op | 2 allocs/op |
| logrus | 10369 ns/op | 5275 B/op | 78 allocs/op |
| go-kit | 6969 ns/op | 3204 B/op | 70 allocs/op |
| log15 | 22246 ns/op | 4783 B/op | 91 allocs/op |
| apex/log | 16379 ns/op | 3608 B/op | 63 allocs/op |

Log a message using a logger that already has 10 fields of context:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| :zap: zap | 231 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |
| logrus | 8532 ns/op | 3438 B/op | 61 allocs/op |
| go-kit | 6874 ns/op | 2486 B/op | 48 allocs/op |
| log15 | 20462 ns/op | 4118 B/op | 70 allocs/op |
| apex/log | 13886 ns/op | 2384 B/op | 48 allocs/op |

Log a static string, without any context or `printf`-style formatting:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| :zap: zap | 222 ns/op | 0 B/op | 0 allocs/op |
| standard library | 565 ns/op | 32 B/op | 2 allocs/op |
| logrus | 3085 ns/op | 1336 B/op | 26 allocs/op |
| go-kit | 1061 ns/op | 624 B/op | 13 allocs/op |
| log15 | 5462 ns/op | 1351 B/op | 23 allocs/op |
| apex/log | 3009 ns/op | 584 B/op | 11 allocs/op |

## Development Status: Beta
Ready for adventurous users, but we're planning several breaking changes before
releasing version 1.0. [This project][v1] tracks our progress toward a stable
release.
